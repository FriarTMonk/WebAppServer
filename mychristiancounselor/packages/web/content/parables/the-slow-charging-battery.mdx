# The Parable of the Slow-Charging Battery

<ParableStory>
A traveler named Caleb relied on his phone for everything—maps, music, messages home, even the flashlight when the trail grew dark. One morning the battery was at 8%. He plugged it into a small portable charger, but the progress bar moved so slowly he almost gave up.

"This is useless," he muttered, tempted to toss it and walk on without guidance.

Hours passed; the percentage crept up—12%, 19%, 28%. By evening, when the path narrowed and night fell, the phone reached 92% and the light guided him safely to camp.

Caleb laughed at himself later. The charger had been working the whole time—he just couldn't see the change fast enough. The tiny trickle of power had been enough to carry him through the day.

<SubtleMoral>
The kingdom of God is like a slow-charging battery in a weary traveler's hand. The seed of faith starts small—sometimes barely noticeable—and progress feels painfully slow. Yet day by day, moment by moment, the charge builds until it becomes strength for the journey, light in the darkness, and a source others can draw from.

<ScriptureTieIn verse="Matthew 13:31-32" version="ESV">
"The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants..."

Just as Caleb's phone charged steadily despite his impatience, God's work in our lives often progresses at a pace that tests our faith. The mustard seed doesn't become a tree overnight, and spiritual growth rarely follows the timeline we demand. But the One who began the good work is faithful to complete it—whether we can see the percentage tick up or not.

<ReflectionQuestion>
Where in your faith life do you feel like the battery is stuck at a low percentage? Can you trust that even the slow charge is building something strong?
