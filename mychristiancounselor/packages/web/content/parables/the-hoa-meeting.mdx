# The Parable of the HOA Meeting

<ParableStory>
Carlos Rivera moved into the Maple Grove subdivision on a Saturday in May, excited about his first house and the neighborhood's reputation for tight-knit community. By Tuesday, he discovered that "tight-knit" sometimes means "entangled in bitter conflict."

The war was between Mrs. Patterson at 1247 and Mr. Kumar at 1249. The property line between them was disputed—six inches of fence that belonged to someone, and both claimed ownership with the passion of generals defending strategic territory.

Mrs. Patterson said the fence encroached on her rose garden. Mr. Kumar said his survey proved otherwise. Both had lawyers. Both had presented evidence to the HOA. Both had stopped speaking to each other two years ago, communicating only through passive-aggressive notes and competing complaints.

The neighborhood was forced to choose sides. Block parties died. The community garden withered. The annual Fourth of July cookout was canceled because neither would attend if the other was invited.

Carlos attended his first HOA meeting that Thursday. The tension was thick enough to cut. Mrs. Patterson sat on the left side of the room. Mr. Kumar sat on the right. No one sat in the middle.

The HOA president sighed. "We've been over this for two years. Neither of you will compromise. We can't force a resolution. So we're at an impasse."

Carlos raised his hand. Being new, he had nothing to lose.

"What if," he said slowly, "we stopped trying to solve the property line and started solving the actual problem?"

Both neighbors glared at him. "The property line IS the problem," Mrs. Patterson snapped.

"No," Carlos said gently. "The problem is that two neighbors who used to wave to each other can't stand being in the same room. The fence is just the excuse."

Silence. Then Mr. Kumar spoke, voice tight: "You don't understand what she—"

"You're right," Carlos interrupted. "I don't. But I'm inviting both of you to dinner at my place Friday night. Not to argue about the fence. Just to eat. And if you can't come to the same table, then forget solving the property line—you've got a bigger problem than six inches of wood."

Mrs. Patterson stood up. "I won't sit across from someone who—"

"Then sit next to each other," Carlos said. "Or don't come at all. But I'm cooking enough food for three, and I really hate eating alone."

Friday night, Carlos set his dining table with care. He made his grandmother's tamales, rice, beans, the works. At 6:00, his doorbell rang. Mrs. Patterson stood there, holding a pie, looking terrified.

"I almost didn't come," she admitted.

"But you did," Carlos smiled. "That's the hard part."

At 6:15, Mr. Kumar arrived with a bottle of wine. He and Mrs. Patterson froze when they saw each other. For a long moment, no one moved.

"The food's getting cold," Carlos said cheerfully. "And my grandmother's tamales don't deserve that disrespect."

The dinner started in excruciating silence. Carlos told stories about his grandmother, his move, his disastrous attempt to plant tomatoes. Slowly—so slowly—Mrs. Patterson mentioned that her roses weren't doing well this year. Mr. Kumar, a retired botanist, suggested a solution before he could stop himself.

They talked about roses for twenty minutes. Then about the old neighborhood families who'd moved away. Then about how the subdivision used to throw block parties that everyone actually attended.

"I miss that," Mrs. Patterson said quietly. "Before all this started, we used to be... friendly."

"I miss it too," Mr. Kumar admitted. "I don't even care about the fence anymore. I just didn't know how to back down without losing face."

"Neither did I," Mrs. Patterson said.

Carlos stood up. "I'm going to get dessert. When I come back, maybe you two could talk about what you actually want—not the fence, but what you want for this street, this neighborhood."

When he returned with plates of pie, they were both crying. And laughing. And making plans to restart the community garden together.

The fence dispute? They hired a mediator the next week and settled it in one afternoon. Turned out when two people actually like each other again, six inches of property line doesn't matter much.

At the next HOA meeting, Mrs. Patterson and Mr. Kumar announced they were co-hosting the Fourth of July cookout. The room erupted in applause.

The president caught Carlos afterward. "How did you do that? We've been trying to mediate for two years."

Carlos shrugged. "You were trying to solve a legal problem. I just invited them to dinner. Peace doesn't start with contracts—it starts with a table where people remember they're human."

<SubtleMoral>
The kingdom of heaven is like a new neighbor who walked into a war over six inches of fence and refused to take sides, instead creating a space where enemies could remember they were meant to be friends. And in building that bridge, he was called a child of God—because that's what God's children do: they set tables in the middle of conflict zones.
</SubtleMoral>

<ScriptureTieIn verse="Matthew 5:9" version="ESV">
"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."

Notice Jesus doesn't say "blessed are the peacekeepers"—those who maintain surface-level calm while resentment festers. He says "peacemakers"—those who actively build bridges, who create spaces where reconciliation can happen. Carlos didn't fix the property line; he reminded two people they were more than their dispute. God's children are marked by this work: not neutrality, but active love that risks rejection to pursue restoration. We are called children of God because peacemaking is the family business.

<ReflectionQuestion>
What conflict are you avoiding because it's easier to keep the peace than make the peace? Who needs you to set a table in the middle of their war—not to fix it, but to remind them what they're fighting for?
