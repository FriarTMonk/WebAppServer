# The Parable of the Open Ticket

<ParableStory>
Eli was the junior DevOps engineer everyone loved. Always smiling, always available, always saying yes.

"Sure, I can take that."

"No problem, I'll handle it."

"Don't worry, I've got it."

The team loved him because he made their lives easier. He stayed late, picked up tickets others didn't want, volunteered for weekend deployments. Helpful, pleasant, present.

But there were cracks, if you looked closely. Calendar notifications he dismissed without reading. A task list that kept growing, never shrinking. Coffee cups accumulating on his desk like archaeological layers. He was agreeing to conflicting priorities from different managers, but he hadn't told either one.

His commitments multiplied. Three different projects. Two teams. Somehow he'd become the go-to person for "quick favors." Each yes felt small in the moment. But they compounded like interest on a loan he couldn't afford.

He started missing things. Small things at first—a delayed response, a meeting he forgot to prep for. He apologized profusely, worked even later to catch up, said yes to the next request to prove he was still reliable.

The spiral tightened. Working through lunch. Answering Slack messages at 11 PM. Coming in on Saturdays. His personal life started disappearing—missed gym sessions, cancelled dinners with friends, a text from his sister he hadn't returned in two weeks.

But he kept smiling. Kept saying "I've got it."

Because stopping would mean disappointing someone. And disappointing someone would mean... what? Losing their approval? Proving he wasn't good enough? Being expendable?

He didn't let himself answer that question. He just kept saying yes.

Among all these commitments, there was a routine task that kept getting pushed to tomorrow: renewing the SSL certificate for a critical internal service. It was on his list. He saw the reminder. But there was always something more urgent, someone who needed him *right now*.

---

Tuesday morning. 6:47 AM.

Eli's phone exploded with notifications.

The internal service was down. Authentication failing across multiple systems. Engineers couldn't access deployment tools. The morning standup descended into chaos.

He knew immediately. The certificate. It had expired overnight.

The fix took twenty minutes. The impact lasted all morning—blocked deployments, delayed releases, frustrated teams. Nothing catastrophic, but very, very visible.

Eli apologized in every Slack channel. Worked through lunch fixing the downstream issues. Stayed late documenting what happened. He expected anger, disappointment, maybe a formal reprimand.

Instead, he got a calendar invitation: "1:1 - Dan" for the next morning.

---

Dan, his manager, didn't start with the outage. He started with a question.

"Eli, how many active projects are you supporting right now?"

Eli rattled off the list. Dan wrote them down. The list filled the whiteboard.

"And how many of these did I assign you?"

Eli paused. "Three."

"So where did the other seven come from?"

"People... asked. And I said yes."

Dan leaned back in his chair. "Eli, you're a good engineer. But I don't need you to be a good yes-person. This is a thinking job. I need your judgment, your perspective, your ability to say 'I can't take that on right now' when you're at capacity."

Silence hung between them.

Then Dan asked the question that broke something open: "Who are you when no one's asking you for something?"

Eli opened his mouth. Closed it. He had no answer.

---

Dan didn't fire him. He put him on administrative leave—paid, one week, mandatory.

"You're burned out, and you need space to figure out who you are outside of being needed."

Eli protested. "I can fix this. I'll work harder, I'll—"

"That's the problem, Eli. You can't fix this by doing more. You have to fix this by figuring out what you're actually here to do."

---

The first two days of leave felt like withdrawal. Eli kept reaching for his phone to check Slack. He wrote apology emails he didn't send. He made lists of how he'd prove himself when he returned.

But by day three, in the silence of his apartment with no one asking him for anything, the question found him again:

*Who am I when no one's asking me for something?*

He tried to answer. Came up blank.

He'd been Eli-the-helpful, Eli-the-available, Eli-the-guy-who-never-says-no for so long that he didn't know what was underneath. His preferences, his opinions, his boundaries—he'd erased them all in service of being needed.

It was terrifying.

And clarifying.

---

Monday morning. Eli walked back into the office with a knot in his stomach. He wasn't sure who he was supposed to be now.

The team welcomed him back—genuine warmth, no resentment. Several people said they'd missed him. He realized they actually liked *him*, not just his willingness to take their work.

That afternoon, the team meeting. Planning next quarter's infrastructure updates. The requests started flying:

"Eli, can you own the database migration?"

"Eli, we need someone on the monitoring upgrade."

"Hey Eli, I know you're good with Kubernetes, could you—"

He felt the old pattern trying to reassert itself. The pull to say yes, to be helpful, to prove he was back and reliable. His mouth opened.

Then he heard Dan's question in his head: *Who are you when no one's asking you for something?*

And he heard his own answer, the one he'd found in the silence: *I don't know yet. But I want to find out.*

"I can take the monitoring upgrade," Eli said slowly. "But I can't take the database migration *and* the Kubernetes project. That's how we got here last time."

The room went quiet.

Then Dan spoke up. "Eli's right. We need to staff these properly, not pile them on one person because he's willing to drown quietly."

Someone else volunteered for the database work. The Kubernetes project got pushed to next quarter. The meeting continued.

Eli's hands were shaking under the table.

But he'd said no. And the world hadn't ended.

---

A few weeks later:

Eli was working on the monitoring upgrade. Someone asked if he could take on an urgent ticket. He checked his capacity, thought for a moment.

"I can get to it Thursday. If it needs to happen before then, you'll need to assign it to someone else."

"Thursday works. Thanks."

Eli closed his laptop at 5:30 PM and went to the gym for the first time in months. His phone buzzed with a Slack message.

He didn't check it until the next morning.

Small changes. But they were his.

<SubtleMoral>
We can become so addicted to being needed that we forget who we are when no one's asking. A yes that comes from fear of disappointing others isn't integrity—it's erasure.
</SubtleMoral>

<ScriptureTieIn verse="Galatians 1:10" version="NIV">
"Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ."

Paul's question cuts to the heart of Eli's crisis: you cannot serve two masters. Every time Eli said yes to gain someone's approval, he was building his identity on shifting sand—on the opinions, needs, and demands of people who could never be fully satisfied.

The people-pleaser's lie is that if you just help enough, do enough, say yes enough times, you'll finally be secure. But human approval is an endless appetite. There's always one more request, one more person to please, one more standard to meet.

Eli's breaking point wasn't the outage—it was the realization that he'd erased himself trying to earn something (approval, security, worth) that can only come from God.

When we reframe our work as service to Christ rather than a performance for human approval, everything shifts. As Paul writes in Colossians 3:23-24, "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters... It is the Lord Christ you are serving."

We can say no without guilt because we're not trying to prove our worth—we already have it. We can disappoint people because we're not ultimately working for their approval. We can bring our actual thinking, our real voice, our honest capacity—because we're serving an audience of One.

And here's the truth about integrity: a yes that comes from people-pleasing isn't really a yes—it's a performance, a manipulation, an attempt to control how others see us. But a yes that comes from knowing who we are in Christ? That's a yes with integrity. And a no from that same place? That's not rejection—it's honesty.
</ScriptureTieIn>

<ReflectionQuestion>
Who are you when no one's asking you for something? If you can't answer that question, what have you been using people-pleasing to avoid facing? What would it look like to work as unto the Lord rather than for human approval—and what would you need to say no to in order to start?
