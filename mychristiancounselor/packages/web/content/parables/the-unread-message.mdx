# The Parable of the Unread Message

<ParableStory>
Sarah had a phone full of notifications, but one message sat unread for months. It came from her former friend Jordan after a painful argument—words of apology mixed with explanation. Sarah had been deeply hurt; every time the notification appeared, anger rose again.

She told herself, "I'll read it when I'm ready," but "ready" never came. Instead, she replayed the offense in her mind, building a case, sharing the story with others, letting the wound stay open and infected.

One day her phone died completely. When she got a new one, the old messages didn't transfer—except for a single screenshot she had saved of Jordan's text. Reading it fresh, without the heat of the moment, Sarah saw the sincerity she had ignored.

Tears fell as she realized how much bitterness she had carried while Jordan had been waiting for a simple "I forgive you." She typed a reply: "I'm sorry it took so long. I forgive you. And I'm sorry too."

The weight lifted, and peace returned like a quiet sunrise.

<SubtleMoral>
The kingdom of God is like a person who receives a message of reconciliation but leaves it unread, nursing the hurt instead of releasing it. When we refuse to extend mercy, we chain ourselves to the very pain we could have been freed from.
</SubtleMoral>

<ScriptureTieIn verse="Ephesians 4:32" version="ESV">
"Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you."

The Master has already forgiven a debt far greater than any we owe each other. Just as Sarah kept the notification unread while freedom waited in a simple tap, we sometimes hold onto bitterness when forgiveness could heal both parties. The same mercy we have received freely is the mercy we are called to extend.

<ReflectionQuestion>
Is there an "unread message" in your heart—an apology you've refused, or a wrong you've replayed too many times? What would happen if you opened it today?
