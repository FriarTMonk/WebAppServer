# The Parable of the Busy Gardener

<ParableStory>
Marcus took great pride in his garden. He tested the soil daily, adjusted the pH balance, measured sunlight exposure, and calculated precise watering schedules. He read every gardening book and followed every expert's advice.

But he never planted anything.

"The conditions aren't quite right yet," he would say. "Just a few more adjustments and it will be perfect."

Meanwhile, his neighbor's garden, which received basic care but nothing elaborate, flourished with vegetables and flowers. The neighbor simply planted seeds, watered them regularly, and trusted the process.

When someone asked Marcus why his meticulously prepared soil remained empty, he replied, "I'm still optimizing. Growth requires perfect conditions."

The neighbor overheard and smiled gently. "No, my friend. Growth requires seeds, time, and trust. Perfect conditions are an illusion that prevents the actual work."

<SubtleMoral>
We can become so focused on creating perfect conditions that we never actually begin.

<ScriptureTieIn verse="1 Corinthians 3:6-7" version="NIV">
"I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow."

Paul reminds us that our job is to plant and water - to take faithful action and trust God with the results. We cannot control the growth; that's God's domain. Like Marcus, we can spend our whole lives "preparing" and never actually step out in faith, missing the beautiful things God wants to grow through our obedience.

<ReflectionQuestion>
What are you endlessly "preparing" for instead of simply trusting God and beginning? What seeds has God called you to plant that you're holding back because conditions don't feel perfect?
