# The Parable of the Forgotten Password

<ParableStory>
There was once a young woman named Mia who loved her digital life. She had accounts for everything—work email, banking, social connections, even her favorite prayer app where she kept her daily verses and gratitude notes. One evening, after a long day, she tried to log in to check a message from a friend. But the password wouldn't work. She had changed it months ago during a stressful time and forgotten to update her notes.

Frustrated, she tried every variation she could think of: birthdays, pet names, favorite Bible verses. Nothing. In panic, she reset it—again and again—locking herself out further. Finally, exhausted, she slammed the laptop shut and sat in the dark, feeling cut off from everyone and everything important.

The next morning, still locked out, Mia remembered an old backup email she rarely checked. She logged in there and found a forgotten recovery link from years earlier—one she had set up "just in case." With a few clicks, the door reopened. Her prayer app was still there, untouched, with all her notes and verses waiting. Even the little reminders she had set for herself popped up: "Be still and know..." (Psalm 46:10). Tears came as she realized how much she had missed in her rush to "fix" things herself.

God does not wait passively; He searches diligently, sending reminders through a quiet whisper, a friend's word, a verse that appears unexpectedly, or even a moment of crisis that forces us to stop and look for the "old recovery path."

<ScriptureTieIn verse="Luke 15:4,7" version="ESV">
"What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? ... Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance."

In the same way, the kingdom of God is like a person who loses access to what matters most—not through a forgotten password, but through the distractions and burdens of life that build up walls between them and their Creator. And when even one lost soul remembers and returns, there is joy in heaven greater than over ninety-nine who never wandered.

<ReflectionQuestion>
Where in your life have you built up "forgotten passwords"—habits, worries, or pride—that keep you from easy access to God's presence? What small step might unlock the door today?
