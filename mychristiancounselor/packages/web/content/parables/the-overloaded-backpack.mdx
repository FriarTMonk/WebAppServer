# The Parable of the Overloaded Backpack

<ParableStory>
A young man named Ethan carried a large backpack everywhere he went. At first it held only the essentials: his phone, wallet, keys, and a small notebook of things he needed to do. But over time he kept adding more—extra chargers "just in case," old receipts he might need, snacks for emergencies, a water bottle that was never empty, and layer after layer of worries: "What if I miss the deadline?" "What if the car breaks down?" "What if I'm not enough?"

The straps dug into his shoulders, his back ached constantly, and he walked slower every day.

One evening, exhausted, Ethan sat on a park bench and finally opened the pack to see what was really inside. Most of it was useless—expired coupons, broken earbuds, crumpled notes of fears that never came true. He began pulling things out, one by one, until the bag was lighter.

At the very bottom he found a small folded paper he had forgotten: a verse his grandmother had written years ago—"Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you" (1 Peter 5:7). As he read it, he felt the weight lift—not all at once, but enough to stand up straight again.

<SubtleMoral>
The kingdom of God is like a traveler who carries an overloaded backpack, filling it with tomorrow's troubles instead of today's bread. The wise traveler opens the pack daily, hands the unnecessary burdens to the One who can carry them, and walks freely—trusting that what is needed will be provided.
</SubtleMoral>

<ScriptureTieIn verse="Matthew 6:34" version="ESV">
"Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."

Just as Ethan discovered most of his backpack was filled with unnecessary weight—worries about scenarios that never materialized—we often burden ourselves with anxieties about tomorrow while God is calling us to trust Him one day at a time. The Master knows what we need before we ask, and His provision is sufficient for each day's journey.

What extra weight are you carrying in your backpack right now—worries about tomorrow that steal your peace today? What one thing could you hand over?
