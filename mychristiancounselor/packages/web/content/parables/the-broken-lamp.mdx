# The Parable of the Broken Lamp

<ParableStory>
Elena inherited a beautiful lamp from her grandmother - an antique piece with intricate stained glass. One day, while cleaning, she accidentally knocked it over. The base cracked, and several glass pieces shattered.

Heartbroken, she hid the lamp in her closet. Every few months, she would take it out, look at it, and think about getting it repaired. But she never did.

"The repair shop would have to take it completely apart," she told herself. "They'd see every flaw, every weakness in the structure. What if they find it's beyond repair? What if I've damaged something irreplaceable?"

So the lamp sat in darkness, beautiful but broken, unable to fulfill its purpose.

Years later, a friend discovered it. "Why don't you get this fixed? There's an expert restorer downtown."

"It would be too invasive," Elena protested. "They'd have to dismantle everything I'm trying to hold together."

Her friend replied gently, "But Elena, it's already broken. The only question is whether you'll let someone who knows how to fix it actually do their work."

<SubtleMoral>
We often keep our brokenness hidden, not realizing that hiding prevents healing.
</SubtleMoral>

<ScriptureTieIn verse="Psalm 51:17" version="NIV">
"My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise."

David understood something profound: God doesn't reject our brokenness - He uses it as the starting point for restoration. Like Elena's lamp, we can't repair ourselves. The Master Craftsman must take us apart to see where the true damage lies and rebuild us properly. Yes, it's vulnerable. Yes, it requires surrendering control. But it's the only path from brokenness to purpose.

<ReflectionQuestion>
What brokenness are you hiding in the darkness, afraid to bring to the Light for repair? What would it look like to trust God enough to let Him fully examine and restore the broken places?
